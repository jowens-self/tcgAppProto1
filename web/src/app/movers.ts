/**
 * Movers: "what moved this week".
 *
 * Opens on the biggest GAINS over 7 days within the LARGEST tracked game
 * (owner's call, 2026-09-30; it opened on decliners before). The set filter
 * narrows it once you know where you're looking.
 *
 * It used to default to all games at once; that ranked Pokemon and One
 * Piece against each other in one list, which compares markets the owner
 * considers separately. "All games" is still selectable; see
 * defaultGame().
 *
 * The opening values mirror item_movers()'s own defaults (7 days, gains,
 * singles, $1 floor), so the screen and a bare psql call show the same board.
 *
 * Clicking a row opens the card right under it, with the same card view
 * Search uses. It used to open below all fifty rows, where nobody saw it.
