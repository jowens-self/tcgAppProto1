/**
 * One hit from item_search(): a product, not a (product, variant) pair.
 *
 * variantCount rather than a price is deliberate. A product commonly exists
 * as Normal / Holofoil / Reverse Holofoil trading at genuinely different
 * prices, and collapsing those into one "price" is the exact thing
 * CLAUDE.md's sub-type invariant forbids. Search says how many variants
 * exist; ItemVariant (from item_variants()) carries their real prices.
 *
 * setName/game ride along on every hit because card names are ambiguous on
 * their own. 266 Pokemon products match "charizard", dozens named exactly
 * that. A result list without the set is not identifiable.
 *
 * cardNumber/rarity are needed for the same reason and are not decoration:
 * a single set routinely reprints one card at several rarities, and those
 * copies trade at very different prices. SV03 Obsidian Flames has four
 * "Charizard ex": 125/197 Double Rare, 215/197 Ultra Rare, 223/197 Special
 * Illustration Rare, 228/197 Hyper Rare. Both come from extendedData rather
 * than the name: TCGplayer only sometimes appends the number to the name
 * (5,276 of 34,435 singles), while extendedData carries Number and Rarity
 * for all of them, in both tracked games. Null for sealed product, which
 * has neither.
 *
 * variantLabel is the printing qualifier pulled out of the name by
 * variant_label(), such as "Cracked Ice Holo", "Poke Ball Pattern", "2016 World
 * Championship", or null for an ordinary printing. It matters for the same
 * reason cardNumber does: those are separate products at separate prices,
 * and the name is the only place TCGplayer records the distinction. The UI
 * also uses it to mark a card whose image may be the base printing rather
 * than this exact variant (DEVELOPMENT_HISTORY.md Part 21).
 *
 * artBorrowed is true when our picture is provably another printing's
 * (card_image_provenance() 'base_art'), and artOwnerName names that printing
 * when one is listed, null otherwise. The search row says so (Part 54).
