-- Does card_image_provenance() still hold its own definition?
--
-- The function decides whose artwork a card is showing by asking who else
-- claims the same pokemontcg.io card (DEVELOPMENT_HISTORY.md Part 27). The
-- verdict is a property of the GROUP sharing a source_id, not of the row,
-- so the ways it can go wrong are structural: a row escaping the
-- classification entirely, a base_art row with nobody to have borrowed
-- from, or an 'unknown' group that actually does contain a plain listing
-- and should therefore have resolved.
--
-- Run it after touching the function:
--   docker compose exec -T db psql -U cardtracker -d cardtracker \
--     -f - < sql/checks/card_image_provenance_invariants.sql
--
-- Every row must read `t`. These are invariants, not measurements, so the
-- counts in the function's comment will drift as images are imported, but
-- none of these should ever go false.
