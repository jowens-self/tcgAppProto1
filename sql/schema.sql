-- CardTracker schema (v1)
--
-- Design rules baked in here:
--   1. price_snapshots is APPEND-ONLY. We never UPDATE a price row. The whole
--      point of this project is the history; overwriting is the one mistake
--      that can't be undone.
--   2. A price is keyed by (product_id, sub_type_name, snapshot_date), NOT by
--      product_id alone. Pokemon cards exist as Normal / Holofoil / Reverse
--      Holofoil of the same product and they trade at different prices.
--   3. product_id survives everywhere, so we can always build a link back to
--      the card's page on TCGplayer.

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS categories (
    category_id   INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    name          TEXT NOT NULL,
    modified_on   TIMESTAMPTZ
);

-- Which tcgcsv categories App/BackfillArchive actually pull. Data, not
-- code, on purpose: adding a card game is "INSERT a row," not a code
-- change + rebuild + redeploy. Seeded with Pokemon (3) only, so nothing
-- changes in behavior until another row is added deliberately.
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS tracked_categories (
    category_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    name        TEXT NOT NULL,
    added_at    TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now()

-- Is a printing qualifier part of the card's IDENTITY, or a TREATMENT
-- applied over a base printing? This is the vocabulary judgment Part 26
-- reserved for the owner and Part 27 could not derive: no property of our
-- data distinguishes them, because it is knowledge about how Pokemon cards
-- are printed.
--
--   'identity'  the qualifier names a genuinely different card that
--               pokemontcg.io lists in its own right, usually spelled its
--               own way. Delta Species was an attribute some cards carried
--               during those sets (owner, 2026-08-19), and the catalog has
--               them as "Aerodactyl d". The catalog art IS this card.
--   'treatment' the qualifier is a foil pattern or a stamp applied over a
--               base printing the catalog holds unstamped. Prerelease
--               cards almost always carry a stamp (owner, 2026-08-19), so
--               the catalog picture is missing something the physical card
--               has.
--
-- Kept as DATA, not a CASE in a function, for the same reason
-- tracked_categories is: adding a classification is an INSERT, and the
-- owner can add one without a code change. Deliberately incomplete, since an
-- unclassified qualifier falls back to the structural test in
-- card_image_provenance() rather than being guessed at.
--
-- NOTE the hedge on 'treatment': "almost always" is the owner's own
-- wording and is not flattened into "always" here. A treatment verdict
-- means the picture is probably not this exact printing, not certainly.
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS image_qualifier_class (
    qualifier  TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    class      TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (class IN ('identity','treatment')),
    note       TEXT,
    decided_on DATE NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_DATE
);

-- Seeded with the owner's calls to date. Qualifiers are stored NORMALISED
-- (see normalize_qualifier() in functions.sql): lowercase, hyphens and
-- underscores as spaces, runs of space collapsed. That matters structurally
-- because image_qualifier_class is joined on the normalised form: two rows
-- differing only in spelling would let one image match twice and duplicate
-- itself in the output. Guarded in
-- sql/checks/card_image_provenance_invariants.sql.
--
-- The 44-row tournament/placement block is a single family call by the
-- owner, 2026-08-19, verbatim: "As far as I know these are all in that
-- category". Candidates were found with
-- /finalist|champion|^[0-9]+(st|nd|rd|th) place$/ over the unclassified
-- vocabulary and all reviewed before insertion. The words are seeded
-- explicitly rather than the pattern being evaluated at runtime, so a new
-- qualifier that happens to match is left 'unknown' until someone looks at
-- it, not auto-classified.
--
-- The 77 player names are the World Championship Decks family, a second
-- one-call classification (owner, 2026-08-19, having checked: "a distinctive
-- special edition of that card, essentially the same type of thing as a pre
-- release card"). Selected structurally rather than by pattern: a qualifier
-- qualifies only if every card carrying it sits in the World Championship
-- Decks group, because no string rule reliably recognises a person's name,
-- and guessing at the shape of the string is not the same as knowing what
-- the card is.
