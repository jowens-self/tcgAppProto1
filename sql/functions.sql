-- card OR a sealed item, deliberately, since the math is identical either
-- way and a product_id already has a fixed category the moment you pick
-- it. Named item_*, not card_*, and returns name/is_sealed alongside the
-- numbers specifically so the category is always visible in the result
-- rather than something the caller has to already know or look up
-- separately. Empty result (no row) if either date has no recorded price
-- for that item, deliberately not "nearest available date," so a caller
-- never silently gets a different day than the one they asked for.

--     stripped with the rest of the punctuation. It faces the SAME validity

--
-- How the split is decided:
--   * An explicit '#' always wins: everything left of it is the name,
--     everything right is the number. This is the escape hatch for a card
--     whose name genuinely ends in a number.
--   * Otherwise the LAST whitespace-separated token is treated as a number
--     only if it looks like one (contains a digit, and is otherwise just
--     letters/digits with an optional / or - separator). "Charizard ex"
--     keeps "ex" as part of the name; "VMAX", "GX" and "V" are likewise
--     safe, because none of them contain a digit.
--
-- **The fallback is the important part.** That last-token rule guesses, and
-- it can guess wrong, since a card genuinely named "... 2" would be read as
-- name "..." plus number 2. So when the parsed interpretation returns
-- nothing, the whole original string is retried as a plain name. A wrong
-- guess therefore costs one extra query and is invisible to the user,
-- rather than showing an empty result for a card that does exist. The

-- Movers (v3, added 2026-08-16)
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- Biggest price moves over a window, for the "what moved this week" screen.
--
-- Rows are per (product, variant), NOT per product like item_search. A mover
-- is a specific variant's move, and Holofoil and Reverse Holofoil are different
-- markets that move independently, so collapsing them would be the sub-type
-- invariant violation, not the other way round.
--
-- **MEDIAN over a window at both ends, not a two-point comparison and not
-- a mean.** This is the whole reason the function looks more complicated
-- than "price then vs price now." Thinly-traded cards lurch on single
-- sales: Charizard Star (Delta Species, 84198) sat at $4,000 for weeks,
-- printed $980 for exactly one day, snapped back to $4,000, then settled
-- near $990. Point-to-point that reads as -75% one day and +308% the next,
-- and a decliners board would be topped by that kind of artifact daily.
--
-- This used a MEAN until 2026-08-18 and the change is a correctness fix,
-- not a preference. A mean damps everything, signal included, and worse, it
-- contaminates one window with prices from the other side of a step. Both
-- failures were measured on live data the day of the change:
--
--   * Lillie - 125a/156 (199681, Reverse Holofoil) stepped $41.10 ->
--     $123.32 and held it for eight days. A genuine +200.0% move. The mean
--     reported +80.0%, because one day of the post-step price leaked into
--     the "then" window. The median reports +200.0% exactly.
--   * Flaaffy (85475, Reverse Holofoil) sat at $1.69 for nine days then
--     moved to $50.83. The mean called the current price $34.45, a number
--     the card has never traded at. The median says $50.83.
--
-- A median leaves steps and monotone trends untouched while annihilating
-- single-sample impulses outright: the $980 artifact above becomes exactly
-- $4,000 rather than a damped $2,993 that still shows a phantom -25%. That
-- is a property of the filter, not a tuning choice. See
-- DEVELOPMENT_HISTORY.md Part 24, and game_set_overview()'s despiking,
-- which rests on the same property.
--
-- Prefer an ODD p_smoothing. At odd sizes the median is a price the card
-- was genuinely at on some day; at even sizes percentile_cont interpolates
-- between the two middle days and can report a price never observed, which
-- is the exact failure the mean was replaced for. Default 3.
--
-- A median does react faster than the mean it replaced, so genuine one-day
-- noise on thin cards now shows at full size rather than damped. p_min_price
-- is what keeps that off the board.
--
-- Both windows must be FULLY covered (n = p_smoothing at each end).
-- A partial window would take the median of fewer days and quietly weight
-- them more.
--
-- p_min_price exists because percent change flatters cheap cards: without
-- it the top decliner for a week was Shuckle at $0.06 -> $0.01 (-83%), and
-- four of the top twelve were sub-$1 cards moving a few cents. Defaults to
-- $1, applied to the STARTING average.
--
-- market_price only, no mid/low fallback, same reasoning as item_return
-- (DEVELOPMENT_HISTORY.md Part 12): a fallback price on a two-anchor
-- comparison is where the -99% return bug came from.
--
-- Restricted to the basket present in both windows, like set_return, so
-- tcgcsv covering more or fewer products between the two dates can never
-- masquerade as a price move.
--
-- p_modern_only filters BEFORE the LIMIT, which is why it is a parameter and
-- not something a caller can do to the result: cutting 50 rows and then
-- discarding the old ones would leave a short board.
--
-- Launch pricing (p_include_prerelease, p_include_early) is left out by
-- default, for the same before-the-LIMIT reason. A card whose "then" price
-- was a preorder or still settling (launch_noise()) is not on the board:
-- on 2026-09-29, 28 of the 50 biggest modern drops were cards that did not
-- exist ten weeks earlier, sliding the way every new set does. Only the
-- "then" end is checked, because "now" is later and can't be earlier in a
-- card's life.
--
-- The 9- and 10-argument forms are signatures from before p_modern_only and
-- the launch flags. Dropped so an existing database does not keep them as
-- second, ambiguous overloads.

-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Set overview (added 2026-08-18, despiking added same day)
--
-- One row per set: what it's worth today and how it moved over a window.
-- The per-set primitives set_value()/set_return() already answer this for
-- one set, but the screen needs every set of a game at once, 302 tracked
-- groups, so calling them per set is 604 round trips. This is those two
-- functions' definitions computed set-wide in a single pass; the semantics
-- are deliberately identical (with p_despike = FALSE, see below), and
-- set_return()'s numbers are the reference these must match.
--
-- Three things carried over from the primitives, all load-bearing:
--
--   * Singles only (is_sealed = FALSE), hardcoded, not a parameter. Same
--     hard rule as set_return(); see this file's header and CLAUDE.md.
--   * The return uses only rows priced on BOTH days (an inner join on
--     product_id + sub_type_name), so a set's composition changing inside
--     the window can't masquerade as a price move.
--   * pct_return is NULL, never 0, when the starting basket is <= 0.
--
-- Hence n_priced vs n_common, and total_value vs total_end: value is every
-- single priced on the end date, the return is only the common basket.
--
-- WHY THE CONCENTRATION COLUMNS EXIST (top_*). Measured 2026-08-18: among
-- Pokemon sets with a >=2% 30-day move, the single largest contributing row
-- is routinely 50-87% of ALL movement in the set. Base Set (Shadowless)
-- read +59.96% on a basket of 202, and $9,750 of the $10,718 move was one
-- row, Charizard 1st Edition Holofoil, whose market_price sits at ~$250 or
-- at exactly $10,000 for weeks at a time. Report the biggest single
-- contributor and its share of gross movement, so a set carried by one row
-- is visible instead of quietly trusted. top_share is a share of GROSS
-- movement (SUM of |delta|), not of the net: net goes through zero, and
-- ratios against it explode to meaningless four-digit percentages.
--
-- DESPIKING (p_despike). A separate defect from the above, and the owner's
-- call on 2026-08-18: a price that swings hard and is back to its previous
-- level the very next day is almost certainly an upstream error, not a
-- move. The test keys on persistence, not magnitude: a real move leaves a
-- new level behind it, an error leaves the same level on both sides, so it
-- needs no opinion about how large a genuine move may be.
--
-- A reading is replaced with median(prev, cur, next) when all of:
--   * both neighbour days exist and are positive;
--   * the neighbours agree with each other within p_despike_tolerance;
--   * cur deviates from their midpoint by >= p_despike_deviation;
--   * and the distortion is at least p_despike_min_usd.
--
-- MEDIAN, not mean, and that is the whole point. Measured on Charizard
-- Star (84198), which has both a real step (970 -> 4000 on 2026-07-24) and
-- a one-day artifact ($980 on 2026-08-04 between $4,000 either side):
--   median-3: artifact -> 4000 (gone entirely), step preserved at full size
--             on the correct day.
--   mean-3:   artifact -> 2993 (a phantom -25% survives), AND the real step
--             smears across three days, inventing a +108% move on 07-23
--             that never happened.
-- A mean damps everything including real moves; a median annihilates
-- single-sample impulses and leaves steps and trends untouched.
--
-- The dollar gate exists because the effect is heavily tailed. Over the 90
-- days to 2026-08-18 there were 4,700 such spikes, but 4,652 were sub-$1
-- penny cards worth $138 in total, while 15 spikes carried $32,440, or 99.4%
-- of all distortion. Filtering everything would churn thousands of rows to
-- fix rounding noise; $10 catches 26 spikes and 99.6% of the money.
--
-- LIMITATION, and it is structural, not an implementation gap: the newest
-- snapshot_date has no next day, so its readings can NEVER be despiked -
-- the confirming evidence hasn't been observed yet. The "now" endpoint of
-- every screen is exactly that date. This cleans history well and today not
-- at all; today's reading gets its check tomorrow.
--
-- p_despike defaults TRUE, but sql/checks/set_overview_matches_primitives.sql
-- calls it FALSE: set_return() is a raw two-point comparison, so with
-- despiking on the two legitimately disagree wherever a spike was replaced.
-- Passing FALSE keeps that check testing the aggregation logic, which is
-- what it is for.
--
-- p_days defaults to 30 rather than movers' 7: a set of 200+ cards averages
-- out most of what a week shows.
-- Adding the despike parameters changed this function's signature, and
-- CREATE OR REPLACE does not replace across signatures. It creates a second
-- OVERLOAD, leaving the old 3-argument version behind. Two candidates then
-- make game_set_overview(NULL, 30) ambiguous and it fails to resolve at all.
-- Same guard as item_movers() above, for the same reason. The 7-argument
-- drop is for the return type: is_modern was added as the last column, and
-- CREATE OR REPLACE cannot change a return type.
--
-- is_modern is a column rather than a filter parameter because the screen
-- already receives every set in one response and filters client-side; the
-- rule itself stays in modern_group_ids().
--
-- LAUNCH PRICING (p_include_prerelease, p_include_early), left out of the
-- CHANGE by default: a card whose start-of-window price was a preorder or
-- still settling (launch_noise()) is dropped from the return basket. Value
-- is untouched, since what a set is worth today is a real number either way.
-- The case that prompted it: ME: 30th Celebration read -97.47% over 30 days
-- on a basket of 5 cards, every one of them a pre-release price.
--
-- settles_on is the set's own release + its game's early_days, when that is
-- after the window start, so the screen can say why a new set has no change
-- yet. NULL for settled and undated sets.

--    their names promise. Verified on disk (Part 27): plain Blastoise
--    13/95 (Unleashed) and both the Cracked Ice Holo and Prerelease
--    listings of it are three byte-identical files (md5 4cc2be6f...),
--    while Acerola 112/147 and Acerola (Full Art) 142/147 hash differently
--    and are visibly different cards: bordered art against full-bleed.
--
-- 2. Vocabulary: image_qualifier_class, the owner's domain calls. The
--    structural test has a blind spot it cannot see on its own: a sole
--    claimant is only proof that no OTHER product took the picture, not
--    that the picture matches the physical card. "Bronzong - SWSH091
--    (Prerelease)" is a sole claimant and its file is the ordinary Battle
--    Styles promo with no prerelease stamp. Since prerelease cards almost
--    always carry a stamp (owner, 2026-08-19), sole-claimancy gave 18 such
--    cards a false all-clear until the vocabulary table was consulted.
--    Conversely Delta Species is card identity, not a treatment, so its
--    159 sole claimants are genuinely correct, the same structural fact
--    reads oppositely depending on the word, which is exactly why the word
--    has to come from someone who knows Pokemon printings.
--
-- Verdicts:
--   'own_art'  sole claimant, or the unqualified claimant of a shared
--              card, or an 'identity' qualifier among qualified claimants
--   'base_art' the picture is not this printing: either an unqualified
--              product claims the same card, or the qualifier is a
--              'treatment' whose stamp/foil the catalog art never carries.
--              owner_product_id names the holder when one exists; a
--              treatment with no plain sibling listed has none.
--   'unknown'  shared, every claimant qualified, and no classification
--              settles it. Genuinely open, not a guess.
--
-- Measured 2026-08-19 over 26,166 ok rows, with two qualifiers classified.
--
-- Two things this deliberately does NOT do. It does not write a verdict
-- column: a later import that finally matches the missing plain printing,
-- or one more row in image_qualifier_class, would silently invalidate a
-- stored value, the staleness argument that keeps all-time-high computed
-- on demand (CLAUDE.md, Data invariants). And it does not treat 'unknown'
-- as a synonym for base_art.
--
-- Note it also catches rows stripped_qualifier never flagged at all: a
-- product can match on its own name and still share a picture. Provenance
-- is about the image, not about how the name matched.

-- success. The answer had to come from the data rather than an exit status.

-- on every page load. Bounding the lookup to the last four days reads
-- idx_snapshots_date instead and takes 250ms - the same trick item_movers()
-- documents. The unbounded fallback runs ONLY when the narrow window found
-- nothing, i.e. only when data really has stopped, which is exactly when a
-- slower answer is the one worth having. Four days rather than two so the
-- staleness threshold has margin either side and the number reported near
-- the boundary is still exact.

-- claim and a wrong one.

-- in the mirror's data is not the collection becoming worthless for a day,

-- final point disagree with the headline total, and a chart that contradicts
-- the number above it is worse than one with a shorter line.
--
-- unpriced counts positions held that day with no price at all, so the caller
-- can say what the figure leaves out instead of quietly understating it.
