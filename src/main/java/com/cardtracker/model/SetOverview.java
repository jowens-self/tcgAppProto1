/**
 * One row of game_set_overview(): a set's current value and how it moved
 * over a window.
 *
 * Per SET, and singles only: sealed product never contributes to a set
 * aggregate (see sql/functions.sql header and CLAUDE.md). Sealed items stay
 * individually trackable through item_return()/item_all_time_high().
 *
 * Two count/total pairs, and they are not redundant. {@code nPriced} and
 * {@code totalValue} cover every single priced on {@code endDate};
 * {@code nCommon}, {@code totalStart} and {@code totalEnd} cover only the
 * rows priced on BOTH dates, which is the basket {@code pctReturn} is
 * computed over. They diverge whenever a card was priced today but not at
 * the start of the window, and a client should say so rather than show two
 * numbers that look like they ought to match.
 *
 * The top* fields are a deliberate honesty measure, not decoration.
 * Measured 2026-08-18: among Pokemon sets with a >=2% 30-day move, the
 * single biggest contributing row is routinely 50-87% of all movement in
 * the set. A percentage on its own invites a reader to treat a set-wide
 * verdict as broad when one thin-market card produced it. {@code topShare}
 * is a share of GROSS movement (sum of absolute deltas), so it stays
 * meaningful for sets whose gains and losses nearly cancel.
 *
 * {@code pctReturn} is null, never zero, when the starting basket is <= 0.
 *
 * {@code nDespiked} counts readings replaced by the median of their two
 * neighbours because they swung hard and came straight back, which is an upstream
 * error rather than a move (see game_set_overview()). It is usually 0, and
 * that is expected: the effect is rare but heavy-tailed. When it fires it
 * can be decisive. On 2026-08-04, one substitution moved EX Dragon
 * Frontiers from -20.91% to +8.43%. Show it wherever the return is shown;
 * a corrected number that doesn't say it was corrected is worse than either
 * honest alternative.
 *
 * {@code modern} is whether the set counts as modern for its game; the rule
 * lives in modern_group_ids().
