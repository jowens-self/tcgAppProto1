-- Is the price history still whole?

-- A MISSING day self-heals: `App` runs gap catch-up unconditionally, tcgcsv's
-- archives persist to 2024-02-08 (verified by request 2026-08-21, not
-- assumed), and the next run fills it. Skipping a week costs seven days of
-- delay and nothing else.
--
-- A SHORT day does not. A partial ingest leaves the date PRESENT, so gap
-- catch-up will never look at it again, since there is no gap to find. It stays
-- wrong until a person notices, and until 2026-08-21 nobody was watching.
-- That asymmetry is what this file is for; the rest is cheap to carry
-- alongside.

--
-- Every `ok` column must read `t`. `detail` is a number, never a verdict, so
-- a failing row says how bad it is rather than only that it is bad.
--
-- COST: ~20s, most of it the one scan of price_snapshots joined to products
-- (41M rows). That is why day_counts is MATERIALIZED. Without it the planner
-- re-runs that scan for each assertion that reads it.
--
-- Two things deliberately NOT asserted:
--
--   * Duplicate (product_id, snapshot_date). Multiple rows per product per day
--     are correct: TCGplayer prices each printing separately, and the primary
--     key is (product_id, sub_type_name, snapshot_date). The PK already makes
--     a true duplicate impossible, so a check here would only restate the
--     schema. Written down because the naive version of this check flagged
--     12,245,214 "duplicates" that were all legitimate printings.
--
--   * Orphan snapshots existing at all. 134 products (53,278 rows, 0.13%)
--     have price history and no `products` row: BackfillArchive sees a bare
--     product_id from an archive and never a name, so a product that left
--     tcgcsv's catalog keeps its history without ever gaining a catalog entry.
--     That is the append-only design working. They are invisible to every
--     query (all of them join products), so no number is wrong. What IS
--     asserted is that no orphan is still receiving snapshots, which would
--     mean the daily pull had started writing prices for products it cannot
--     name, which is a different thing entirely.
--
-- NOTHING HERE COMPARES A DATA DATE TO A WALL CLOCK, and that is deliberate.
-- The first draft asserted "newest snapshot is no more than 1 day old" and
-- failed on a perfectly healthy database, because CURRENT_DATE inside this
-- container is UTC while the machine writing the data is UTC-5: for five
-- hours every evening the two disagree about what day it is. That is the
-- same defect CLAUDE.md calls the rule most likely to be "simplified" back
-- into a bug. PriceSource.dataAsOf() exists precisely so the pull dates
-- itself from the mirror rather than from a clock, and SourceGuardsTest
-- fails the build on a bare LocalDate.now(). A check that reintroduced it
-- would have been worse than no check: a suite that cries wolf every
-- evening teaches people to stop reading it.
--
-- Freshness is a real question, but it is an OPERATIONAL one and it belongs
-- to ./status.sh, which reports the newest snapshot date and lets a person
-- judge it. This file answers "is what we have intact", which is a question
-- the data can answer about itself.
