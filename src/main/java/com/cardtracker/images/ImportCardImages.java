/**
 * Matches our Pokemon products against the pokemontcg.io catalog and caches a
 * downscaled thumbnail on local disk.
 *
 * Run it:
 *   java -cp target/cardtracker-0.1.0.jar com.cardtracker.images.ImportCardImages
 *   ... [--limit N] [--group GROUP_ID] [--match-only] [--skip-failed]
 *
 * **Why images are cached locally rather than hotlinked.** The browser must
 * never contact a third party for these - our own API serves them off disk.
 * That was the rule that got broken once already with TCGplayer's CDN (see
 * CLAUDE.md), and it applies to a permitted host too: fetch once, serve
 * forever, no per-view traffic to anyone.
 *
 * **Coverage is 94.1%, and the ~60% it sat at before was a bug, not a
 * ceiling.** Measured then: 16,841 of 27,807 Pokemon singles matched
 * (60.6%); after the two fixes below, 26,166. An earlier
 * version of this comment blamed the gap on the upstream catalog, claiming
 * "World Championship decks / jumbo / prize packs / promos are absent
 * entirely." **That claim is false** - audited 2026-08-18 against the
 * cached catalog: `swshp` alone carries 304 promo cards we had written off.
 * The real causes are two normalization defects below - see
 * DEVELOPMENT_HISTORY.md Part 21. Replayed offline, fixing both recovers
 * 8,834 of the 10,912 no_match rows (81%).
 *
 * 1. {@link #LEADING_DIGITS} is anchored, so {@link #numberDigits} returns
 *    null for any number not starting with a digit (H1, SV066, SWSH014,
 *    RC4, TG12, GG46). That null is fatal on BOTH sides: 1,550 of 20,479
 *    catalog cards (7.6%) are never indexed, and those products never
 *    attempt a match.
 * 2. {@link #normName} strips a trailing "- 123" and "- 4/5" but not a
 *    trailing parenthetical or letter-number token, so "Alakazam (H1)" and
 *    "Rillaboom V - SWSH014" never match their bare catalog names.
 *
 * **Both were fixed 2026-08-19** (Part 26). Matching now runs in two tiers:
 * tier 1 uses the product's name with its printing qualifier intact, and
 * only if that finds nothing does tier 2 retry with the qualifier stripped.
 * Tier 1 is preferred because the catalog usually carries the qualifier too
 * ("Professor's Research (Professor Magnolia)"), so it resolves to the
 * card's own artwork. Reaching tier 2 means the catalog holds no card
 * bearing that printing, so the image is the base printing's - and the
 * qualifier that had to be dropped is stored in
 * {@code card_images.stripped_qualifier}.
 *
 * That column is a FACT about the match, not a verdict on the artwork -
 * "Cracked Ice Holo" is a foil treatment over existing art, while "Delta
 * Species" is card identity pokemontcg.io spells as "Aerodactyl δ". Storing
 * the word rather than a verdict is what let the verdict be computed later
 * without re-running an 80-minute import. Note the qualifier is decided at
 * match time and never by comparing set names: the two catalogs disagree on
 * those.
 *
 * **This part of Part 26 was superseded - do not re-derive it.** The comment
 * here used to conclude that whether a stripped qualifier means the picture
 * is wrong "has no mechanical answer." Part 27 found one: a pokemontcg.io
 * card is one picture, so asking which OTHER products claim the same
 * {@code source_id} settles most of it structurally, and the owner's
 * treatment/identity calls in {@code image_qualifier_class} settle the rest.
 * {@code card_image_provenance()} in sql/functions.sql combines the two. The
 * verdict is computed there, never stored here.
 *
 * **Record the stripped word VERBATIM - do not normalise it in this class.**
 * TCGplayer genuinely sells both "Semi-Finalist" and "Semi Finalist"
 * printings, so folding them here would destroy a true fact about the catalog
 * to tidy a lookup table. Spelling variants are reconciled at comparison
 * time by {@code normalize_qualifier()} instead. Part 27.
 *
 * Use {@code --dry-run} to measure rules without writing or downloading
 * anything. It exists because the misses this records are permanent, and
 * the rules have been wrong before - the dry run caught a defect in the
 * first version of the tier-2 test, which mistook parenthesised card
 * numbers ("Aerodactyl (1)") for printing qualifiers.
 *
 * Misses are recorded as status='no_match' so they are never re-queried -
 * which is why changing any of the above also requires clearing those rows.
