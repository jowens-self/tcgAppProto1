#
# Why this exists: schema.sql is mounted at docker-entrypoint-initdb.d and runs
# ONCE, on an empty data directory. This database was initialised on 2026-08-12
# and holds 42M price rows, so schema.sql has not executed since and never will
# again. Without a runner, every change after the first boot is a psql command
# somebody remembers to type, on one machine, undocumented.
#
# schema.sql stays the canonical definition for a FRESH database. A migration
# is the same change expressed for a database that already exists. Both must be
# written, or a new container and this one diverge - which is why the header of
# each migration says what it mirrors in schema.sql.
#
# Each file runs inside a single transaction with ON_ERROR_STOP, so a migration
# either lands completely or not at all; there is no half-applied state to
# unpick by hand. Migrations should still be written idempotently (IF NOT
# EXISTS, ON CONFLICT), because the cheapest recovery from any doubt is running
# it again.
#
# Reads the same defaults as the app, overridable the same way:
#   CARDTRACKER_DB_CONTAINER   (default: cardtracker-db)
#   CARDTRACKER_DB_USER        (default: cardtracker)
#   CARDTRACKER_DB_NAME        (default: cardtracker)
