-- Does is_variant_word() still behave like the Java port it must mirror?
--
-- ImportCardImages.isVariantWord() decides which products get an image, and
-- is_variant_word() decides which get a label. CLAUDE.md calls them
-- "change both or neither" because a disagreement means a row's picture and
-- its caption were chosen by different rules.
--
-- The Java side trims its argument internally. The SQL side did not until
-- 2026-08-20, so the two matched only while every caller remembered to
-- btrim() first, and variant_label() does, which is why nothing was ever
-- visibly wrong. Both bugs these rules exist to prevent return the moment a
-- caller forgets: ' Z ' clears the length floor that keeps all 26
-- "Unown [A]".."[Z]" from reading as variants, and ' XY73 ' slips past the
-- card-code test that keeps "Latios EX (XY72)" from doing the same.
-- Measured before the fix: 81 of 2,547 real tokens flipped verdict when
-- padded with a single space either side.
--
-- This cannot call the Java directly, so it checks the property that makes
-- the two equivalent (the SQL function is insensitive to surrounding
-- whitespace), plus the two documented bug shapes by name.
--
-- Run it after touching either implementation:
--   docker compose exec -T db psql -U cardtracker -d cardtracker \
--     -f - < sql/checks/is_variant_word_matches_its_java_port.sql
--
-- Every column must read `t`.
