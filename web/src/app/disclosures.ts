 *
 * Owner's request, 2026-09-30. This page is a promise about the code, so it
 * changes whenever a rule it describes changes (CLAUDE.md says so). The rules
 * that are data (each game's modern cutoff and early-pricing length, the
 * staleness threshold) are read live rather than written in, and the user's
 * own boxes are shown as they are set, so those parts can't drift. The fixed
 * thresholds (3-day medians, $10 despiking, the flipping rule) are written
 * here and in sql/functions.sql, and each side names the other.
