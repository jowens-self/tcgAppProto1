 * That is deliberate. Snapshotting real output would pin whatever the
 * functions currently do, including any bug, and this project has shipped
 * numbers that looked plausible and were wrong, like a set worth $25,100.93 that
 * was really $2,792.05, a +200% step reported as +80%. A fixture you can do
 * arithmetic on is the only kind that can catch that.
 *
 * The products are real printings with their real shapes, because the rules
 * under test were each written for a specific card.
