 * purpose: ~300 sets arrive in one response, so both are free and cost no
 * round trip. Add a server-side ORDER BY only if this ever paginates.
 *
 * Note which state is a signal and which is a plain field. Anything `visible`
 * reads must be a signal or the computed won't recompute when it changes;
 * `game` and `days` are plain fields because changing them refetches, which
 * updates `rows` anyway.
 *
 * On CONCENTRATION, which is why this screen shows more than a percentage.
 * Measured 2026-08-18 against real data: among Pokemon sets with a >=2%
 * 30-day move, the biggest single contributing row is routinely 50-87% of
 * all movement in the set. Base Set (Shadowless) read +59.96% and $9,750 of
 * its $10,718 move was one card whose market price toggles between ~$250
 * and exactly $10,000 for weeks at a time. Showing the percentage alone
 * would let a one-card artifact read as a set-wide verdict, so the biggest
 * contributor is shown beside it and flagged past a threshold.
