-- Does game_set_overview() still agree with set_value() and set_return()?
--
-- game_set_overview() exists because the screen needs every set at once and
-- the per-set primitives would be 604 round trips (302 groups x 2). That
-- makes it a SECOND definition of numbers set_value()/set_return() already
-- define, exactly the duplication the "handlers call SQL functions, not
-- inline SQL" rule exists to prevent. The duplication is only acceptable
-- while this check passes.
--
-- Run it after touching either side:
--   docker compose exec -T db psql -U cardtracker -d cardtracker \
--     -f - < sql/checks/set_overview_matches_primitives.sql
--
-- Every column must read `t`. IS NOT DISTINCT FROM is used rather than =
-- so that null matches null: a set with no common basket has a NULL return
-- on both sides, and `NULL = NULL` would report that agreement as failure.
--
-- Checks the top 20 by value rather than all 302, since it calls two functions
-- per set, so the full sweep is slow, and the high-value sets are where a
-- divergence would matter most. Raise the LIMIT for a fuller sweep.
--
-- DESPIKING IS DELIBERATELY OFF here (the FALSE argument). set_return() is
-- a raw two-point comparison, so with despiking on the two legitimately
-- disagree wherever a suspect reading was replaced, and that is the feature
-- working, not a regression. Passing FALSE keeps this check testing the
-- aggregation logic, which is what it exists for.
