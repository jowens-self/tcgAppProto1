/**
 * Resolves the local card-image directory, and refuses to start when the
 * default cannot mean what it says.
 *
 * Both sides of that directory resolve through here so they cannot disagree:
 * {@code ImportCardImages} writes thumbnails into it, {@code ApiServer} serves
 * them out of it, and they are only the same directory when both processes
 * were launched from the same place.
 *
 * **Why this refuses rather than resolving against the jar.** The default
 * {@code images} is a relative path, so it names a different directory for
 * every working directory a process is launched from. Launched anywhere but
 * the project root, the importer created a fresh empty tree and downloaded
 * into it while the API went on serving 404s from the real one - neither side
 * erroring, which is why it went unnoticed for a day (CLAUDE.md, "Run tools
 * from the project root"). Resolving against the jar instead would put images
 * under {@code target/}, which {@code mvn package} is free to wipe, so the
 * directory stays where it is and the launch is checked instead.
 *
 * An explicit {@code CARDTRACKER_IMAGE_DIR} is always honoured unchecked - a
 * path someone set is a decision, not an accident.
